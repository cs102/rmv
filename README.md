This is the same book as Massachusetts Drivers Manual as provided by https://www.mass.gov/doc/english-drivers-manual/download ...

The original manual comes with Arial Narrow font which to some of us with bad eyes is a nightmare to read even with glasses. I offer a few versions of this manual for readability and Web accessibility in mind.
